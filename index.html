        <h2>Experience of Reverend William Lawson</h2>
       
        <p>Lawson hasn't slowed down when it comes to activism. In the summer of 2020, after George Floyd's murder, Lawson joined the march honoring Floyd in Houston. ABC13 anchor Melanie Lawson said her father felt that it was important and insisted on attending the march in person, even at age 91.</p>

       <p>Rev. Lawson was joined by thousands of other Houstonians who marched from Discovery Green to City Hall.

The march was organized by Houston entertainers Trae Tha Truth and Bun B, and it has included Floyd's family, some of whom flew in to attend.
